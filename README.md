# hawk

## HTTP Holder-Of-Key Authentication Scheme.

Documentation of the protocol, and the JS API, is in https://github.com/mozilla/hawk/blob/main/API.md.

## Security maintenance only

This was once `hueniverse/hawk` and relased as `hawk`.

Then, after the 7.0.10 release, it was moved to the `hapijs/hawk` repository and released as `@hapi/hawk`.

Hapi later de-supported the library, after releasing version 8.0.0.

It has since been moved to `mozilla/hawk` and is again released as `hawk`.

All of the intermediate versions are also released as `hawk`.

Changes are represented in the `main` branch on this repository.

Mozilla claims in `mozilla/hawk` they maintain (i.e. stating "maintenance mode") and yet the sole maintainer declares in an issue they are not affiliated with Mozilla and makes the statement that the repository is likely abandoned.

Mozilla maintains several Hawk implementations in different languages.

This library is in "security maintenance mode" -- no features will be added, no functionality fixes will be considered, and only security-related bugfixes will be applied.
